## Documentation
The purpose of this program is to provide an IPv4 and IPv6 compliant FTP server that accurately communicates with the client.
To create the running program, a Makefile is provided. Type 'make' to create an executable, and 'make clean' to delete the executable. 
Using the Windows Powershell, execute the program through the command ‘./server.exe’. Through another Powershell window, type the command ‘FTP’ to connect to the built-in Windows FTP client. Once in the FTP client, open a connection through the command ‘open [IP Address] [port # (optional)]’. 
Follow the provided ‘Sample_ftp_ipv6_interaction’ for further instruction.
