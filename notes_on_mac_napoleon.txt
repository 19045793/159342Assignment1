0. open a terminal

1. to install packages on mac more easily, use homebrew package manager.

install homebrew:  https://grew.sh/

2. copy the installation instructions from the webiste of homebrew:

e.g.  paste this in the terminal, then run.

		/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"



3. install gcc by using the following command in the terminal.

    brew install gcc. (installs latest version, g++-12, gcc-12)


4. check the files installed.
   
   cd /user/local/bin/

   ls. (see the gcc, g++ programs installed)


5. to test if gcc installation succeeded:
	
	At the terminal, type: 

	   gcc-12 (see results)

	   g++-12

	   g++




6.  g++ is linked to clang by default, but we want it to be associated with g++-12; therefore, we need to manually link them together.

	ln -s g++-12 g++

7. log out, then sign-in to see the results of linking.


8.  Later versions of MacOS do not have built-in ftp, etc. and so they need to be installed manually using homebrew.  

    brew install inetutils
